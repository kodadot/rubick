# Rubick

## Prerequisites

* node 16.x
* docker

## Quickly running the sample

Example commands below use [make(1)](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).
Please, have a look at commands in [Makefile](Makefile) if your platform doesn't support it.
On Windows we recommend to use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm ci

# 2. Compile typescript files
make build

# 3. Start target Postgres database and detach
make up

# 4. Apply database migrations from db/migrations
make migrate

# 5. Start the processor
make process

# 6. The command above will block the terminal
#    being busy with fetching the chain data, 
#    transforming and storing it in the target database.
#
#    To start the graphql server open the separate terminal
#    and run
make serve

# 7. Now you can see the resuls by visiting the localhost:4350/graphql
```

## Project structure

Hydra tools expect a certain directory layout:

* `src/generated` - model/server definitions created by `codegen`. Do not alter the contents of this directory manually.
* `src/server-extension` - module with custom `type-graphql` based resolvers
* `src/types` - data type definitions for chain events and extrinsics created by `typegen`.
* `src/mappings` - mapping module.
* `lib` - compiled js files. The structure of this directory must reflect `src`.
* `.env` - hydra tools are heavily driven by environment variables defined here or supplied by a shell.

If you do not plan to extend GraphQl server you can delete `server-extension` module and then remove 
`type-graphql` and `class-validator` dependencies.

## Dev flow

### 1. Define database schema

Start development by defining the schema of the target database via `schema.graphql`.
Schema definition consists of regular graphql type declarations annotated with custom directives.
Full description of `schema.graphql` dialect is available [here](https://docs.subsquid.io/schema-file/).

### 2. Generate TypeORM classes

Mapping developers use [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io) entities
to interact with the target database during data processing. All necessary entity classes are
generated by the squid framework from `schema.graphql`. This is done by running `npx squid-typeorm-codegen`
command.

### 3. Generate database migration

All database changes are applied through migration files located at `db/migrations`.
`squid-typeorm-migration(1)` tool provides several commands to drive the process.
It is all [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/migrations) under the hood.

```bash
# Connect to database, analyze its state and generate migration to match the target schema.
# The target schema is derived from entity classes generated earlier.
# Don't forget to compile your entity classes beforehand!
npx squid-typeorm-migration generate

# Create template file for custom database changes
npx squid-typeorm-migration create

# Apply database migrations from `db/migrations`
npx squid-typeorm-migration apply

# Revert the last performed migration
npx squid-typeorm-migration revert         
```

## Setting up the project for resolvers

In case you just want to extend resolvers you don't index the whole project and just import the postgres database (last data 29.03.2023):

1. [Contact @vikiival on Discord](https://discord.gg/yfeumhRCuw)
2. `docker-compose up db`
3. `docker exec -it rubick-db-1 psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE squid;"`
4. `docker exec -i rubick-db-1 psql -U postgres -d squid < rubick.sql`

⚠️ In case the command does not work, check if the container is called `rubick-db-1`.

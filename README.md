# Rubick

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/chOyZePGEHDoTSY2CA/giphy.gif)

This is a sample project generated by `hydra-cli scaffold`. Experiment by modifying `schema.graphql` and the mappings in the `mappings` folder.

## Fast Forward

```
just up
just codegen
just build
just reset
just explore
```

Start processor
```
just process
```

Run GraphQL queries
```
just serve
```

## Prerequisites

* Node v14x
* Docker

## Bootstrap

```bash
# The dependencies setup relies on de-duplication, use `ci` to get everything right
npm ci

# Start a postgres instance
docker-compose up db # add optional -d flag to detach from terminal

# Apply migrations related to the processor's state keeping tables
npm run processor:migrate

# Apply the project's migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Now you can start processing chain data
npm run processor:start

# The above command will block
# Open a separate terminal and launch the graphql server to query the processed data
npm run query-node:start
```

## Project structure

Hydra tools expect a certain directory layout:

* `src/generated` - model/server definitions created by `codegen`. Do not alter the contents of this directory manually.
* `src/server-extension` - module with custom `type-graphql` based resolvers
* `src/types` - data type definitions for chain events and extrinsics created by `typegen`.
* `src/mappings` - mapping module.
* `lib` - compiled js files. The structure of this directory must reflect `src`.
* `.env` - hydra tools are heavily driven by environment variables defined here or supplied by a shell.

If you do not plan to extend GraphQl server you can delete `server-extension` module and then remove 
`type-graphql` and `class-validator` dependencies.

## Development flow

If you modified `schema.graphql`:

```bash
# Run codegen to re-generate model/server files
npm run codegen

# Analyze database state and create a new migration to match generated models
npm run db:create-migration # add -n "myName" to skip the migration name prompt

# Apply the migrations
npm run db:migrate
```

You might want update the `Initial` migration instead of creating a new one (e.g. during the development phase when the production database is not yet set up). In that case it convenient to reset the database schema and start afresh:

```bash
rm db/migrations/LastUnappliedMigration.ts
npm run db:reset
npm run db:create-migration
npm run db:migrate
```

To generate new type definitions for chain events and extrinsics:

```bash
# Review typegen section of manifest.yml (https://docs.subsquid.io/hydra-typegen)

# Delete old definitions
rm -rf src/types

# Run typegen tool
npm run typegen
```

## Setting up the project for resolvers

In case you just want to extend resolvers you don't index the whole project and just import the postgres database (last data 11.05.2022):

1. [Download the data](https://storage.googleapis.com/bright-meridian-316511-db-export/rubick.sql)
2. `docker-compose up db`
3. `docker exec -it rubick-db-1 psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE rubick;"`
4. `docker exec -i rubick-db-1 psql -U postgres -d squid < rubick.sql`

⚠️ In case the command does not work, check if the container is called `rubick-db-1`.
